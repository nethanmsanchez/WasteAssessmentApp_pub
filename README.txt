Waste Assessment Application
Nethan S

The Waste Assessment Application was created for a group at UCSC for a final project in my Mobile Applications (CMPS121) course taken
in my 4th year (2019). The group wanted an application to help them conduct waste audits, which entails collecting data on the contents
of different waste containers for different waste stream types. The key desired aspects were for it to be free, have a UI that makes
the data entry easy, have the app walk/guide the user through conducting a waste autit with no prior knowledge, to have it be stored
and accessable, to limit users to those with @ucsc email addresses, and finally to have some basic charts/diagrams for convenient data
visualization. This project was worked on in a group of three with my peer's Ray and Ryan. We split up the work as evenly as possible
with Ray handling the data visualization aspect, Ryan setting up the database and database operations, and I worked on UI and data entry
using many fragments to make it easy to insert, edit, and delete data easily as well as desiging the java objects to make logic easy and
uniform through out all three of our contributions.
